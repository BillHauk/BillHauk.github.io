## Working Papers

### Heinrich Pesch and the Anglo-German Divide in Economics
*The Rev. Heinrich Pesch, S.J. was a German economist and social philosopher who was an active scholar from the 1890s to 1920s.  His work had a significant impact on a generation of German Catholic social thinkers and particularly the papal encyclical <i>Quadragesimo Anno</i>.  His method of social analysis, which he called Solidarism, was informed by Catholic Social Thought, but based on natural law principles that he argued were accessible to all people of good will.  This article argues that, although his school of thought did not survive the Nazi and World War II years, many of his ideas had a lingering effect on Economic thought for the German center-right.  This influence may be contrasted with the center-right in the English-speaking world, where there was a strong divorce between Christian social thinking and Economics.  Consequently, a gap emerged between Economic policy in Germany and Britain, which contributed to some of the divides leading to Brexit.*

### Small States, Big Pork (with Romain Wacziarg)
#### Published in [<i>Quarterly Journal of Political Science</i> 2007](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/QJPS-5048)
*Using data on authorizations from the 2005 Highway Bill, we show that the legislative allocation of pork barrel spending by US state (measured by the value of transportation earmarks per capita) greatly favors smaller states. We exploit the difference between two versions of the bill: the version that was passed by the House and the compromise version passed in conference committee. Our empirical results provide strong evidence in favor of theories of legislative malapportionment.*


#### <u>The effects of increased eye contact on feeding portions</u>
*In this paper I estimate the effect of increased eye contact on the size of feeding portions delivered by my humans. Over a period of several months I varied the amount of time I spent in locked eye contact with my masters while secretely recording the total amount of food provided each day. The results incidate that the relationship between eye contact and portion size is concave, in that as eye contact increases, the portion size increases up until a point where it begins to decrease. Future research will examine whether time spent cuddling exhibits a similar relationship.*
