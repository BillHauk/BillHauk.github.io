### Heinrich Pesch and the Anglo-German Divide in Economics
The Rev. Heinrich Pesch, S.J. was a German economist and social philosopher who was an active scholar from the 1890s to 1920s.  His work had a significant impact on a generation of German Catholic social thinkers and particularly the papal encyclical <i>Quadragesimo Anno</i>.  His method of social analysis, which he called Solidarism, was informed by Catholic Social Thought, but based on natural law principles that he argued were accessible to all people of good will.  This article argues that, although his school of thought did not survive the Nazi and World War II years, many of his ideas had a lingering effect on Economic thought for the German center-right.  This influence may be contrasted with the center-right in the English-speaking world, where there was a strong divorce between Christian social thinking and Economics.  Consequently, a gap emerged between Economic policy in Germany and Britain, which contributed to some of the divides leading to Brexit.

### U.S. Import and Export Elasticities:  A Panel Data Approach
#### Published in [<i>Empirical Economics</i>](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-011-0456-1)
This article describes the creation of a new dataset on sectoral-level import and export elasticities in the U.S. between the years 1978 and 2001. It proposes the use of panel data techniques as a means of generating import price indexes, and then using them to measure trade elasticities while instrumenting for the endogeneous variables. In particular, it provides a dataset listing trade elasticities for a broad range of sectors at the North American Industry Classification System 4-digit, and 6-digit and the Harmonized Tariff System 6-digit, and 10-digit levels of industry aggregation. These results are compared to previous estimates in the literature. The resulting estimates can be used in a wide-range of applications in empirical studies of international trade policy, particularly in analyzing the welfare effects of international trade.

### Protection with Many Sellers:  An Application to Legislatures with Malapportionment
#### Published in [<i>Economics and Politics</i> 2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0343.2011.00387.x)
What effect, if any, does legislative malapportionment have on international trade protection? This paper argues that in malapportioned legislatures, such as the U.S. Senate, industries become over‐represented in a legislature if they are disproportionately located in small constituencies. As a result, industries that are disproportionately located in smaller constituencies are likely to receive greater protection from international trade. To argue this point theoretically, this paper develops a new model, combining legislative bargaining and a model of lobbying to study trade protection while allowing for a legislature with multiple legislators and differently sized constituencies. We then test the predictions of this new model using tariff votes from the U.S. Senate in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and a panel of tariffs and non‐tariff barriers to trade in the U.S. in the 1990s. Considerable support is found for the model's predictions. Industries concentrated in states where the population is low receive greater protection from imports.

### A Monte Carlo Study of Growth Regressions (with Romain Wacziarg)
#### Published in [<i>Journal of Economic Growth</i> 2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-009-9040-3)
Using Monte Carlo simulations, this paper evaluates the bias properties of estimators commonly used to estimate growth regressions derived from the Solow model. We explicitly allow for measurement error, country-specific fixed effects and regressor endogeneity. An OLS estimator applied to a single cross-section of variables averaged over time (the between estimator) performs best in terms of the extent of bias on each of the estimated coefficients. Fixed-effects and the Arellano–Bond GMM estimator overstate the speed of convergence under a wide variety of assumptions, while the between estimator understates it. Finally, fixed effects and Arellano–Bond bias towards zero the slope estimates on the human and physical capital accumulation variables, while the between estimator and the Blundell–Bond system GMM estimator bias these coefficients upwards.

### Small States, Big Pork (with Romain Wacziarg)
#### Published in [<i>Quarterly Journal of Political Science</i> 2007](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/QJPS-5048)
Using data on authorizations from the 2005 Highway Bill, we show that the legislative allocation of pork barrel spending by US state (measured by the value of transportation earmarks per capita) greatly favors smaller states. We exploit the difference between two versions of the bill: the version that was passed by the House and the compromise version passed in conference committee. Our empirical results provide strong evidence in favor of theories of legislative malapportionment.

#### <u>The effects of increased eye contact on feeding portions</u>
*In this paper I estimate the effect of increased eye contact on the size of feeding portions delivered by my humans. Over a period of several months I varied the amount of time I spent in locked eye contact with my masters while secretely recording the total amount of food provided each day. The results incidate that the relationship between eye contact and portion size is concave, in that as eye contact increases, the portion size increases up until a point where it begins to decrease. Future research will examine whether time spent cuddling exhibits a similar relationship.*
